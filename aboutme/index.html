" <h2>Jaylynn Tautu</h2>
    <p>Talofa, my name is Jaylynn Tautu and I'm from American Samoa. I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science. When I am not busy with school I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I love to be outdoors and being active in sports (mostly vollyeyball)
     I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints since I was 8. A favorite quote of mine comes from President Thomas S. Monson, in a talk titled "Finding joy in the Journey" he said,"Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved." I look foward to learning more about web development with you all!
